## Overview
This project was the final first quarter Fall project for the Northwestern MSR program. In this project, my team and I worked together to program Sawyer, the Robot to detect and draw faces. Our team was awarded first place in Robotics competition. The project is summarized as follows: An image of the userâ€™s face is obtained via webcam and the facial component is isolated for processing which allows us to create motion planning and solve for trajectories for the end-effector of a Sawyer robot (from Rethink Robotics) in order to draw the face. The result is a marker-drawn image of a face on a surface which only requires an initial calibration process which we created for Sawyer to automatically localize the task space and the end-effector. We use a custom, 3D printed marker holder provided by the Master of Science in Robotics program. My main role was developing the face detection algrorithm using OpenCV's Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/ThePenultimatum/finalProject495/blob/vmed/src/face_detect.py).
