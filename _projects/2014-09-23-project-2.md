## Overview

This is the last project from  Northwestern MSR (Masters in Science in Robotics) Hackathon experience. This project introduced hands-on experience with ROS, a robotics middleware which provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. 

In this project, Python and OpenCV were integrated with ROS to program a servo-controlled pan-tilt camera system that can track target objects. A blue ball is detected from the system as shown in the video below:
