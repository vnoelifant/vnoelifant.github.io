## Overview

This is the Challenge #3 project from  Northwestern MSR (Masters in Science in Robotics) Hackathon experience. The purpose of the hackathon challenge was not only to enhance skills in Python by solving challenging problems, but also to practice use in Git to prepare for an exciting year in the MSR program. 

In this challenge, which is borrowed from Googleâ€™s Python class, I wrote a program to parse the Alice in Wonderland novel text [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/alice.txt) and return the the count for each word and the top 20 most common words. See the [Alice Word Count](https://github.com/vnoelifant/msr_hackathon_challenges/blob/master/wordcount.py) code that solves this problem. 

More detailed  instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge3.pdf).
