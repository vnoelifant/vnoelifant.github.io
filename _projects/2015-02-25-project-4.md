## Overview

This is the Challenge #3 project from  Northwestern MSR (Masters in Science in Robotics) Hackathon experience. The purpose of the hackathon challenge was not only to enhance skills in Python by solving challenging problems, but also to practice use in Git to prepare for an exciting year in the MSR program. 

  * The instructions for this challenge are outlined [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge3.pdf). In summary, this is a challenge borrowed from Googleâ€™s Python class, which for which the instructions are as follows: Write a program to parse the Alice in Wonderland novel text [here](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/alice.txt) and returns the the count for each word and the top 20 most common words. See the [Alice Word Count](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~jarvis/hackathon_2018_site/public/docs/challenge3.pdf) code that solves this problem.
