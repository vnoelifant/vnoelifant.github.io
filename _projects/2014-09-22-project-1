## Overview
An image of the userâ€™s face is obtained via webcam and the facial component isolated for processing which allows us to create motion planning and solve for trajectories for the end-effector of a Sawyer robot (from Rethink Robotics) in order to draw the face. The result is a marker-drawn image of a face on a surface which only requires an initial calibration process which we created for Sawyer to automatically localize the task space and the end-effector. We use a custom, 3D printed marker holder provided by the Master of Science in Robotics program. Videos of the results can be found here:
